# Algos
This project is a attempt to make all types of algorithm and data structures available to importing. Although it might not be useful , a insertion sort algorithm could be a import away!

# Motivation
This project is written just as a undergrad practice . Written entirely in Python , it uses no external library for itâ€™s operation. Aim is to convert it into a educational tool to visualize and help students or self-learners . It is extensive and covers weird and rare modifications to a algorithm.

# Usage
To use the project , simply import the module by import algos. Explore and check the many more algorithms and datastructures hidden inside this project. This project can also just be read. Grab a cup of coffee and start!

# Testing
We use unittest for testing . Checkout the test directory for all the tests.
